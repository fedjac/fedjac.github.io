<p class="name1"><b>H&M Global Change Awards</b></p>

<p class="bread1"><b>Together with four other colleagues from Hyper Island we entered the competition. Itâ€™s an innovation challenge and the aim is to come up with ideas that would protect the planet and thus close the loop for fashion. Our contribution was a service called 'Walk-In'. We were really excited by the idea of creating a digital platform where it would be easy and simple to buy and sell used clothes, and thus prolonging the longevity and at the same time creating a new business model for H&M. We envisioned creating a digital service where people in a seamless manner could buy products that very likely would be thrown away. You would also be able to find very rare products. We wanted to create digital wardrobes. </b></p>
