<p class="name1"><b>H&M Global Change Awards</b></p>

<p class="bread1"><b>Together with four other colleagues from Hyper Island we entered the competition. It’s an innovation challenge and the aim is to come up with ideas that would protect the planet and thus close the loop for fashion. Our contribution was a service called 'Walk-In'. We were really excited by the idea of creating a digital platform where it would be easy and simple to buy and sell used clothes, and thus prolonging the longevity and at the same time creating a new business model for H&M. We envisioned creating a digital service where people in a seamless manner could buy products that very likely would be thrown away. You would also be able to find very rare products. We wanted to create digital wardrobes. </b></p>
